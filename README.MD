# dns-validator

> Security tool to detect dns poisoning attacks

## Features:

 - Watches over the transfer of all DNS packets
 - Matches every request with it's response
 - Notifies in case both their `question` header do not match
 - Notifies if any stray packet arrives without a request
 - Gets the IP list for domains requested through an external service
 - Notifies if they don't match the ones in response packets
 - In built cache for speed improvements
 - Runs as daemon process without interfering with normal traffic
 - Log's to any external file

## Requirements
- **Mac OS X**: >= 10.8 or Growl if earlier.
- **Linux**: notify-osd installed (Ubuntu should have this by default)
- **Windows**: >= 8, task bar balloon if earlier or Growl if that is installed.
- **General Fallback**: Growl

## Issue

Major websites use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to host all their static resources. So the IP's that are retreived through some external source may not match the IP's meant for the region dns-validator is being used. Hence these will be notified to the user even if the dns is not really poisoned. Currently I am having a list of cdn websites in `cdn.js` and not matching their IP's. The list is incomplete for now. If you find any solution to this issue feel free to send a pull request!
